/**
 * Pure next-episode resolution for auto-advance / "next up". Given the current
 * episode's (season, episode) and a pool of episodes (typically the current
 * season plus the next), returns the episode immediately after the current one
 * in (season, episode) order, or null at the end of the available range.
 *
 * Ordering is by season then episode, so it rolls over into the next season.
 * Episodes at or before the current position are never returned, so it can't
 * advance backwards or replay the current episode. (Specials in season 0 sort
 * before season 1, so they're only "next" when the current episode is itself a
 * special — a regular episode never auto-advances into specials.)
 *
 * Caller note (B4): build the pool in PLAYBACK order — the current season's
 * episodes plus the next regular season's. Don't merge `Season.isSpecials`
 * seasons in display order (which sorts specials last); this resolver keys on
 * numeric season 0 < 1, so a special season appended after regular seasons
 * wouldn't be reachable as "next". Ties on (season, episode) resolve to the
 * first matching input element (catalog tuples are expected unique).
